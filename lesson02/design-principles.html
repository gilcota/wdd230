                Wikipedia's main web page has the icon centered at the top, and below it a search bar. Then, there is a
                section with several languages options with information of the amount of articles that exist of that
                language; these options are organized in three columns and centered. There is another section of
                languages that hae less articles, this one organized into two columns with a left alignment. The page
                looks organized, giving a good visual impact.

                The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' main web page uses white spaces that divide different
                content such as images, text, sections, etc. It has a clean and easy going design, there is a header, a
                main section of the content and other subsections with addition content, using squared and circular
                images that keep a nice desing.

                There is a main image that is shown, which changes after some seconds, and below it there are
                different sections with a header and an image which are used as options for the visitor to choose
                between the categories of products. This pattern repeats (a header and an image) with different designs
                throughout the page.
